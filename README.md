# Game-Network

## Description

Maybe you’re a casual gamer like me? Or you’re a hardcore streamer that games for a living? It doesn’t matter how much you play, as long as you’re passionate about gaming.
With Gamer’s Network, you can find what games people are talking about and what they really think of them, whether they love them or hate them.

With Gamer’s Network, you can create your own discussion posts. Whether it’s to give your opinion about the new Call of Duty or Halo game, talk about the ridiculous amount of hackers in the gaming scene or you just want to advertise your guild on World of Warcraft, you can do that here and have multiple people commenting and joining in on your discussion.
A big aspect that Gamer’s Network focuses on is allowing users to interact with other users and have the ability to ‘friend’ them so they can get better access to the games they play, or just to build a bigger network so they have people to play with.

## User Story

    - As a user, I want to find friendly people to play games with. I’m tired of playing with randoms that either bail half way through the game or are just toxic and abusive online.
    - As a user, I’ve just started playing the new MMORPG game but don’t have anyone to play with so I’d like to find others that want to join me and have some fun levelling and questing together.
    - As a user, I want to find players that are the same rank as me so we can keep ranking up together.
